## Uncovering Sleep and Lifestyle Patterns for Stress Management and Better Health

Team Byte Crafters

# Introduction 👋
- Project Objective: The objective of our project is to investigate data analysis techniques, propose a model for uncovering sleep and lifestyle patterns, identify factors contributing to stress, and provide strategies for improved stress management and overall health.

- Factors considered: Using diverse Machine learning techniques,Python Libraries like Scikit-learn ,numpy,pandas and Web Application using Streamlit, LLM(Langchain,cTransformers).

- Expected Outcomes: Accurate modeling of sleep and lifestyle patterns to identify stress factors. Development of a real-time application providing insights and recommendations for better health management.

## 🖥️Tech Stack
 To address the challenge of uncovering sleep and lifestyle patterns for stress management and better health, an advanced tech stack was utilized. Core technologies included Streamlit for the interactive application, and LLMs like Langchain, Mistral7B, and cTransformers for generating text responses. ALTAIR RAPID MINER,Python,Jupyter Notebook facilitated data analysis and EDA, while Scikit-Learn implemented machine learning algorithms for predictive modeling. This integrated tech stack enabled a user-friendly tool designed to enhance sleep health and manage stress through personalized insights and recommendations.






```bash
//streamlit
  from streamlit_option_menu import option_menu
  import streamlit as st

//langchain
 from langchain.llms import CTransformers
 from langchain.callbacks.base import BaseCallbackHandler
 from langchain.chains import LLMChain
 from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
```

Use of Streamlit and LLM: The synergy of Streamlit and LLM allows seamless integration, providing an intuitive and efficient platform to build, deploy, and engage with the chatbot, bringing a personalized and responsive conversational experience to the users.
